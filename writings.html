  <p>Once there lived an old man. He was a grumpy person and always thought that he knew everything.
  He had 3 servents, a chicken, a goat and a cow. One time when he was having a discussion with his
  servents about how to raise money and have a better life, one of the servents told a suggestion that 
  "If we use the goat to get milk, we can sell it and get money".The old man said only what I tell is 
  right and what you all tell is wrong, the servents stood quietly after that and would not tell any 
  suggestions. Do you know what the old man had told during that discussion? He said: "We can sell the
   chicken and get more money and we can slaughter the cow and cook the beaf and eat it. The goat will be my pet animal and I can drink the milk it gives". Yes, I know it was not 
  a good idea at all. Well, the old man did not think so and he did what he told. At first everything
  seemed good, but after about a week he did not have anything left but the goat. The servents took pity
  on him and told that "If you had not been so grumpy and listened to our ideas you would not have
  become this poor.But if you listen to us now we will tell you what we think and we might be able
  to live happily again". The old man now understood the importance of listening to others and 
  agreed. The servents shared their ideas and did it their way. They milked the goat every day,
  took a little for themselves and the rest they sold in the market. Soon the old man got enough 
  money, and now he was back to his good old days, but with one difference. The old man was no longer
  grumpy but he became friendly to everyone. He cared to listen to other pepole's suggestions too.

          </p>
         <p>In a village there lived two twin sisters. One was Sara and the other one was Stella.
         They were so alike that people whould not have been able to distinguish them
        had it not been for a peculiar shaped birth mark on Sara. But as they grew up their behaviours
         were not alike at all. Sara grew up to be an unkind and selfish girl while Stella became 
         a helpful and friendly girl. Whenever their mother asked Sara to do any work she whould make
         excuses and let Stella do all the work. One day when both the sisters were collecting berries 
         in the woods, suddenly Stella saw a fairy. Sara was a bit far away from Stella, so she  did not
         see the fairy. The fairy told Stella, "Stella you have been a good girl and helped many
         people, you see when you and your sister were born an evil fairy had put a curse on Sara and
         it is still there in her and that is why she has been a selfish girl. But don't worry there is
        a way to break the curse. If Sara will learn to love and care for someone 
        the curse will be broken." Stella said "Oh, Thankyou kind fairy for telling me this I shall try my 
        best to save my sister." The fairy disappeared after wishing her the best. From then
        on Stella whould do all of Sara's work to try to make her love Stella. But it was a tough task
        as whatever Stella did Sara wouldn't be bothered. One day they went into the woods to collect water
       from the river in the woods. When they were on their way back a lion suddenly appeared 
       and was about to attack Sara, Stella pulled Sara away from the lion and they started to run 
       but the lion soon caught up with them. The lion was about to pounce on Sara when Stella pushed
       the lion away.The lion had fallen into a pit and it was stuck there but while pushing the sharp 
       claws of the lion had scratched Stella in the chest. It had wounded her deeply. Sara chould not believe
       what had just happened because she never did anything for her sister but she has saved me and now
       she is injured too. She cried for her sister and sprinkled some water on her face but she did not 
       wake up, she sobbed and said "Oh, I am so sorry for behaving this way, I love you Stella...
       ". As soon as she said this the birth mark disappeared and a fairy appeared and said, "Dear Sara 
       you have finally learned to love and care for someone.I shall bring her back, she chanted
       "Oh bring Sara's dear twin sister back" as soon as she said this Stella opened her eyes. The 
       sisters embraced each other. They walked back to their house. Now Sara's curse had been broken
       forever. From that day Sara worked hard and she became kind, considerate
       and hardworking. Now the people loved both Stella and Sara.
